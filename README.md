# Zomato-data-analysis

We are analysing the Zomato Restaurant dataset to find the more insights about the Restaurant business. The basic idea of analysing the zomato dataset is to get a fair idea about the factors affecting the aggregate rating of each restaurant. With each new day restaurants are opening, the industry hasn't been saturated and the demand is increasing day by day.

Steps applied here :

Initial analysis : First we understood the given dataset. Looked through it's structure, identify the datatypes of various columns and get a basic idea of the dataset to proceed further.

Data Cleaning : Looked out for visible data quality issues and rectify them. Check for blanks, duplicate data and convert certain columns to required datatypes.

Exploratory Data Analysis : Carried out various operations like univariate, bivariate analysis and then generate useful insights from them.

Data Visualization : used matplotlib, seaborn to plot various graphs for better visualization and understanding.
